# Lao Urban Planning Information System (UPIS) - Project Knowledge

This document serves as a knowledge base for the Lao UPIS project, documenting key design decisions, implementations, and development history.

## Session Summary - April 30, 2025

### Initial Setup and Design

1. **Project Structure**
   - Created a Vue.js application structure
   - Implemented Vue Router for navigation
   - Set up main views: Home, Projects, Project Detail, Task Detail

2. **UI Development**
   - Designed a clean, modern interface with consistent styling
   - Created a fixed navigation bar with the Lao UPIS logo
   - Implemented responsive layouts for all pages
   - Added a link to the Lao Legal Database for quick reference

3. **Project Management Features**
   - Implemented project listing with filtering and sorting
   - Created detailed project view showing progress and team information
   - Built task management system based on the 8 tasks of Lao urban planning process
   - Added document management features for each task

4. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Added filter options for project type, status, and province
   - Implemented progress visualization for projects and tasks
   - Created modal dialogs for document upload functionality
   - Designed intuitive navigation between related views

### Internationalization Implementation

1. **Vue I18n Setup**
   - Added Vue I18n library for internationalization support
   - Created `/src/locales/` directory with translation files
   - Implemented language detection and selection logic
   - Added language preference storage in localStorage

2. **Translation Files**
   - Created comprehensive English translation file (`en.json`)
   - Created complete Korean translation file (`ko.json`)
   - Organized translations hierarchically by component/feature

3. **UI Components Updates**
   - Added LanguageSelector component to the navigation bar
   - Updated all components to use translation keys instead of hardcoded text
   - Implemented helper functions for translating statuses and types
   - Ensured all user-facing text is properly internationalized

4. **Multilingual Support Considerations**
   - Ensured layout accommodates varying text lengths between languages
   - Implemented proper pluralization and parameter substitution
   - Made language switching immediate with no page reload required

   - Implement localized date formatting
   - Add other regional languages as needed

## Technical Decisions

1. **Using Vue 3 with Composition API**
   - Better type safety with TypeScript
   - More maintainable component logic organization
   - Improved reusability of code with composables

2. **Vue I18n for Localization**
   - Robust internationalization support
   - Easy to add additional languages
   - Integration with Vue's reactivity system

3. **Clean UI Design**
   - Focus on usability for non-technical users
   - Responsive design for various device sizes
